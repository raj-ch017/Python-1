README for check_power.py

===========================

The check_power.py script takes in two arguments, number and base.

The script checks whether the number is a power of the base and returns a boolean output.

## Example
	"check_power(10,2)" returns "False" as 10 is not a power of base 2
	"check_power(8,2)" returns "True" as 8 is a power of base 2
